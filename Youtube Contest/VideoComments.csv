1. Dont do any of the app permissions in azure or on dev.powerbi.com
2. In azure for the app, create a secret instead (and copy it!)
3. In azure, create an AAD security group and add this app to it
4. In Power BI tenant settings, enable read only admin API access and add the group you just made in #3
5. In Power BI desktop construct your body string like this (replacing the <<>> bits with your APP ID and APP Secret):
body = ""client_id=<<app client id>>&scope=https://analysis.windows.net/powerbi/api/.default&client_secret=<<app client secret>>&grant_type=client_credentials""

I'm however at an impasse in trying to get the same result in a Line and Stacked Column Chart with sub categories.
In your example, if you add a sub-category (column series) to the chart, which would split the column Personal Accessories (as well as other columns, where available) in several stacked columns, how could one then get a percentage value as data label for each sub-category, while still keeping the Y axis as values (Revenue in your example) instead of percentage?";0;"Positive";"99%";"Sentiment Analysis powered by https://www.impktful.com/"

I think hacks are how we let Microsoft know how to provide more and better features. Data flows are still new and shiny but it's not foolproof yet, unfortunately. When it works with on-premise web API I will be happy :)

If you have a large payload of data that never changes it makes this a great option as the client doesn't need to maintain any separate data source information and worry about scheduling maintenance etc. Making it easier for the end user is always a good path to follow i think,";0;"Positive";"99%";"Sentiment Analysis powered by https://www.impktful.com/"

 Also, give a short overview of the algorithm, how you define the 2 periods, when you use the min and max values to select dates, which is for DAX learners a new trick and then how you put it all together, before you go through the motions.

Assume I have a slicer where I can select above KPI, and Rank of the Zone should populate according to that KPI selection.  
I have tested the same in a table where in Rows I plotted Zones and in Value I plotted all the above KPI and Rank. and as per KPI selection Rank is populating properly and the table is getting sorted accordingly. But when I splitted the box into Card Visual unlike other KPI Rank is going for toss.

For your ref. I used Rank_Total_Sales_No = RANKX(ALL(tblBr[Zone]),CALCULATE(SUM(tblFact[Sales_No])),,DESC,Dense) and Later on I used RANKX(ALL(tblBr[Zone]),CALCULATE(SUM(tblFact[Sales_No]),ALLSELECTED(tblBr[Zone])),,DESC,Dense) as I found it from a blog. However, 1st one is working for Tabular Visual but 2nd one is not working anywhere at all.

Hope I have cleared the issue, and looking for a suggestion from a Power Guru. In case if you are not clear please write to me sukhomoy.developer@gmail.com. I can share the pictorial clarification or sample data.

I have a big table with different columns and when I apply this DAX formula it works, until I filter one value...when I filter one value, rank is always one.

Question on daily changes though. How would you factor in daily values that excludes weekends. A use case is with financial stock calculation for daily price changes - where trading does not take place on weekends.

Any chance to get the “pbix” file for this example?

By the way, have you ever tried to get done a “Dunmbell” visualization like this?
http:\\www.arqmain.net/MJordanQuote/Gender_Earning_Disparity.png   

I did it but using the R integration option in PBI then I got this visualization done.   I would like to find a way to do it but using just PBI alone.  

How about getting a visualization like this as well?

Instead of using the ""W"" ascii character, you can actually apply the asci ALT code 255 which is a blank ascii character. This is treated as a character but not shown on screen. I've been using it for years for web dev. On PC Use ALT and type 255 and you'll get the blank character.

Around 2:14 you go through the steps to activate preview feature, but I am unable to find it in file-> settings.
I am using 2016 at work and 2013 on y personal computer.

I would like to extract the ride details for this URL, so if you can give me some pointers to end up with a simple excel sheet with e.g:
 race name, 
venue,
province
date
date entries closes
distances
and perhaps the url ""Read More""

It would be really awesome to get this info in an easy format to read. I will be using Excel 2013.

Thanking you in advance for your help!!!

"Ugylx440VLmR6LpldY14AaABAg";"Ka7Ds4EAjNQ";"2019-12-31T22:48:50Z";"I agree with Simon Benoit: it seems that the formula for the sum wants to ""reverse engineer"" how PowerBI calculates in order to numerically get to the correct answer for the total. I am wondering if there is an easier way since we only want to display the handful of values shown on the visual (like a for loop in Python, looping the formula used for each row). Also, if we go through the pain of building the complex total formula (used for the total row only in this exmaple), why not opening it up to each row as well (in other words, the whole IF HASONEFILTER section at the beginning is now obsolete, the formula at the end works for individual rows as well). Side note: using https://www.daxformatter.com/ helps your audience ""chew"" on complex formula ;)

But have you tested it against playing around with custom date periods via a direct date slicer and then with designed period options on your new slicer? It seems to work until you won't limit dates with the direct calendar table date slicer, so until more or less all dates stay in scope. If you start, let's say from 15Nov with your custom selection then the alternative selection for Last Qtr won't override this Nov15th and will give you dates only since the mid of Nov not the the 1stOct. I don't know if there might be solution for this case...

It's a very informative and learning example you have chosen to show us. Figuring out how it actually works step by step is definitely worth the effort. 

Since there are no rollups involved SELECTEDVALUE() could be used instead of MAX() this because SELECTEDVALUE() in this case will always return the single Sales[Product line] value that is being processed at any given time.  So you could use (short of the test for all/nothing selected condition)  …

Exclude? =
IF (
    SELECTEDVALUE ( Sales[Product line] )
        IN ALLSELECTED ( 'Product Lines'[Product line] ),
    ""Y"",
    ""N""
)
… instead. I don't think it will make much of a difference in a real data set situation, however, the SELECTEDVALUE() could possibly be easier to understand compared to the MAX() approach??

As a matter of fact, a simple VALUES() will work as well as long as you place the filter in the filter pane after having set up the visual with column values.

Exclude? =
IF (
    VALUES ( Sales[Product line] )
        IN ALLSELECTED ( 'Product Lines'[Product line] ),
    ""Y"",
    ""N""
)

Hello
Please please I need your help it’s very urgent
I need to calculate our company employees net salary , I have two tables 
First table: come from our finger print system have the employee clock in and clock out with columns ( employee id, date, time in and out)
Second table : have the requests send by every employee if his late or absent  ( employee id, request type such as  sick leave or excuse, and date)
The challenge is I want to  join these two tables  to make some calculations such as if he is absent will deduct two days from his  salary if he didn’t send a sick leave.
I don’t know how to  connect both of them , I try  every thing I have learned such as merge or append queries I also try to model it in power bi but it doesn’t work at all time";1;"Positive";"51%";"Sentiment Analysis powered by https://www.impktful.com/"

This is truly awesome! Thank you so much for sharing your brilliant solution!
Even today, when Incremental Refresh is released for Power BI Pro, this is exactly what I need. 
For my Web-API-source the out-of-the-box-Incremental-Refresh does not work, (or at least, I cannot seem to get it to work)
Your method does! However, I seem to have 1 problem: The final step; Combining the fresh data with the historical data doesn''t work. For some reason the query keeps on evaluating, untill it gets cancelled. Therefor, I cannot close and save this dataflow. The separate queries work just fine (I've tried the method in your video as well as the slightly different approach from your blog), but combining them doesn't work...Do you perhaps have an idea why?

Thanks in advance!";1;"Positive";"73%";"Sentiment Analysis powered by https://www.impktful.com/"

That is, select 4 of them as you did in the video and changing something inside all of the measures. For example, if the 4 measures are a calculation on a table and they all use the same table, using some ""find + replace"" way of changing that table in all 4 measures to a new table. Now you'll have the same calculation as before in all 4 measures but they use the new table.

However I have one question, how it would identify the row is an aggregate (subtotal/total), so we can make the icon hidden ?

I tried to add a condition on the same column determine the red or green, so I added if it is BLANK and also if it is zero, then turn the Font color to the same color of my table / matrix color so it looks like there is no icon in that row, but it seems not working.

I mean the real problem (at least mine!) is to be able to sum up the members but your solution instead creates a new formula that allows you to find the answer but you're not summing up the members.

My current issue is that I need to sum up weighted measures. If I do the calculation at the top level, the formula applies the total of all the weights (100%) to the total of all the other column (progression % in my case) so the result is obviously wrong.

The problem remains : how can we purely sum the members at a given aggregation level?";1;"Positive";"70%";"Sentiment Analysis powered by https://www.impktful.com/"

When the engine executes the code of your query and hits the Invokeafter function, the query is already running. It simply waits the specified amount of time to connect to the data source. Try it out with 3 queries starting after 5, 10 and 15sec. Write down the order they ran in. Then rotate the order of the delay and run again. compare the run order with previous results and you will see.
Power BI analyzes which query it requires first and execute them accordingly.

Though I have I problem when I for example want to show 'the selected period' vs 'the same period last year' in a visualization. 

If I selected the MTD, I want I visualization to show the Sales for MTD and the Same period MTD last year. 

I use this function to get the SPLY, but it does not show on the viz when I use your date filtering (only if I select the ""all-time"" option:

By the way, that will be better if we can create an AppFunction at Azure, so we would get a http request with the AccessToken, and all the information regarding user account would be stored your Azure App Function Code instead of a Report.

Q1. How can I calculate sales mix in power BI? I have 3 categories of products (they all have sub products).  category1= 40 unit
   c2           =50 units
  c3          = 20 unit       
   total sales= 110
. 
sales mix for category1= 40/110. How to do this in power bi? 

q2. so basically I sell products on credit ....the outstanding column shows how much the customer should pay for payment to be completed. The other column shows the number of days for the product to be disabled. anything less or equal to -30 is cash at risk...meaning that the product has been disabled for more than 30 days. I want to calculate the portfolio at risk in power Bi but I don't know how to do it.  Portfolio at risk= outstanding balance of products that has <=-30 days to cut-off status divided by the total outstanding amount. 

 outstanding        days_to_cutoff
       400                       4
       200                       -30

When you grant admin consent to the tenant that also has a few security concerns. Think, if a user somehow got this pbix file in an org they could possibly get access to an account that could lead to a data risk if that account has permissions to workspaces, reports, datasets and or dataflows that they normally shouldn't see. For that reason since our user base doesn't have access to Power Automate I've created a custom REST API connector there and did the same thing (could've used powershell as well, but we want to use the power platform atm), then preserve the data in a secure SQL database which is called by a dataflow.

By the way, that will be better if we can create an AppFunction at Azure, so we would get a http request with the AccessToken, and all the information regarding user account would be stored your Azure App Function Code instead of a Report.

Very good video
Thank you for posting it!

I have run this example with another website and I have obtained an excellent result.
This certainly works very well for a few tables (no more than 10). However, when we increase the tables to load (10 or more) it is getting slower and slower.

Now, I have tried to apply the procedure to the website ""www.ine.cl"" to load 4 tables that are under the same link but are changing pages from 1 to 4.

Could you please help me in writing the DAX formula or method which will return a value based on the current day of the week and the corresponding week number?

 Assuming today is Week 1, Tuesday (Day 2), I want to add a ""Card"" visualisation to show ""Project01"" for employee Name01 (assuming I have the separate ""Slicer"" filter for the ""Employee Name"").

 Then the next time I open my Power BI, which will be on Monday next week (Week 2), the same ""Card"" will update automatically and give me the Monday value of Week 2; which for ""Name01"", for instance, is ""Project03"".

 Thank you in advance for the help.

How can I filter from one visual to another visual on same page by clicking on one dimension value and make that selection remains even if I unclick(unselect) it ?

I know there are two options one as highlight another as filter, those options are working  fine but what I want is that the selection should remain even after I unclick it. 

It can be done easily on Tableau with an option called leave the filter from dashboard actions but i didn't see such an option in powerbi.

For that I am using a different visual from marketplace called Attribute Slicer which works fine but the downside is it is like a bar chart, i need a crosstab.

I have an issue with that, I can parameter DB and server in Power BI desktop, but in Power BI Service I can't set those parameters. I think that this is because the use of Direct Query. Do you have any workaround to connect to a source or another depending on the workspace you are in PBI service?


This is a tipical deployment (Pre Workspace should connect to a PreProd DB and Production workspace should connect to Production DB)


I am making a .ps1 script that copies the content of a workspace and then creates another workspace, but i am not able to create the parameters used in PBI desktop into PBI service.

The measure will miscalculate as it's not defined in the ALLEXCEPT(..) funct.  Can you make this measure perfectly dynamic so that it results in the right answer regardless of the filtering col?  Would love your thoughts on best practices in this case.  Use ISFILTERED (ERROR) message?";0;"Positive";"88%";"Sentiment Analysis powered by https://www.impktful.com/"
