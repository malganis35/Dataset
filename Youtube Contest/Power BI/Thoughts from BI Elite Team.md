## Thoughts from the BI Elite team:

Amazing report! I thoroughly enjoyed going through each tab in depth. Right off the bat, I loved the design. The sparklines on the right side feel very dynamic and I love the somewhat muted background images. There's so much great stuff going on on the main tab, but I think my favorite part is the Average Views per Day and Average Subscribers Gained per Day simple cards. They look great and Vinicius manages to fit them into a small space, but they also tell me a lot about my channel's performance in easy-to-understand cards. The "vs LY" calculations were a great touch, and I'll be frequenting back to them to gauge the channel performance.

The slicer panel is probably the cleanest I've ever seen. The report design is honestly perfect and I have no additional critiques! Very well done, and definitely deserving of a winning spot!
