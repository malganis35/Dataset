Not to be confused with Row-Level Security, OLS doesn’t simply hide rows of data from the end user. OLS instead hides whole tables or columns!

In the video, we decide to hide an entire column pertaining to sales revenue. From then on, the end user will not be able to see this column in their report, nor will they be able to see any measures that rely on the column! It’s important to note that this security applies when the user views the report, when the user analyzes the model with Analyze in Excel, and when the user connects to the dataset within Power BI Desktop. It completely hides the restricted columns/tables/measures, almost as if the items don’t exist at all!
