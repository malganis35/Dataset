Use Case Overview


Company Name:

MetroCare Community Hospital


Company overview:

MetroCare Community Hospital is a leading healthcare provider located in a thriving metropolitan area. Our mission is to deliver high-quality, patient-centered care in a compassionate and efficient manner. Our emergency room serves as the first point of contact for a diverse patient population experiencing a wide range of urgent medical issues.

As the ER Manager of MetroCare Community Hospital, I oversee the daily operations of our emergency room, including patient flow, staff allocation, and resource management. My primary goal is to ensure that our patients receive timely, appropriate care while maintaining high levels of satisfaction and minimizing operational costs.


Dataset Overview:

The dataset provided includes the following columns:

    Date: The date the patient visited the emergency room
    patient_id: unique identifier for each patient
    patient_gender: The gender of the patient
    patient_age: The age of the patient at the time of their visit to the emergency room
    patient_sat_score: The patient satisfaction score, measured on a scale (0-10), where 0 is unsatisfied and 10 is very satisfied
    patient_first_initial: The first initial of the patient's first name
    patient_last_name: The patient's last name
    patient_race: The race of the patient (e.g., White, Black, Asian, etc.)
    patient_admin_flag: A flag indicating whether the patient was admitted to the hospital after their emergency room visit (TRUE for admitted, FALSE for not admitted)
    patient_waittime: The waiting time for the patient in the emergency room, measured in minutes
    department_referral: The department within the hospital or the external healthcare provider that referred the patient to the emergency room


Main Business Problem

In recent months, our emergency room has experienced an increase in patient volumes, and we currently have no reporting solution in place to analyse the impact of this growth. We want to understand if patient wait times are being affected by the increased number of patients and identify potential bottlenecks in our processes.

To address this challenge, I am seeking a reporting solution in Power BI that will help our management team gain insights into the current performance of our emergency room, patient demographics (age, gender, race), wait times, admission rates, satisfaction scores, and department referrals. By analyzing these data points, we aim to identify areas for improvement and optimize our emergency room operations.


By implementing this Power BI reporting solution, we aim to:

    Analyse the relationship between the increased number of patients and patient wait times, identifying any correlation or trends that may indicate bottlenecks or inefficiencies in our processes.
    Investigate patient demographics (age, gender, race) to ensure equitable care delivery and understand if certain groups are disproportionately affected by extended wait times.
    Monitor admission rates to assess the efficiency of our patient triage process and resource allocation.
    Examine patient satisfaction scores to evaluate the impact of increased patient volumes and wait times on the overall patient experience.
    Assess department referrals to identify patterns and potential opportunities for collaboration and process improvement.


Ultimately, this reporting solution will empower our management team to make data-driven decisions that enhance the patient experience, improve staff satisfaction, and maintain the highest levels of care quality in our emergency room while accommodating the growing number of patients.
